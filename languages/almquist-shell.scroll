paragraph
 Almquist shell (also known as A Shell, ash and sh) is a lightweight Unix shell originally written by Kenneth Almquist in the late 1980s. Initially a clone of the System V.4 variant of the Bourne shell, it replaced the original Bourne shell in the BSD versions of Unix released in the early 1990s.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
