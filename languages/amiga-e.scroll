paragraph
 Amiga E, or very often simply E, is a programming language created by Wouter van Oortmerssen on the Amiga. He has since moved on to develop the SHEEP programming language for the new AmigaDE platform and the CryScript language (also known as DOG) used during the development of the video game Far Cry.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga_E">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
