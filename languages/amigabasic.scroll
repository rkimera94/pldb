paragraph
 AmigaBASIC was an interpreted BASIC programming language implementation for the Amiga, designed and written by Microsoft.  AmigaBASIC shipped with AmigaOS versions 1.1 to 1.3. It succeeded MetaComCo's ABasiC, which was included in AmigaOS 1.0 and 1.1, and was superseded by ARexx, a REXX-style scripting language, from AmigaOS version 2.0 onwards.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmigaBASIC">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
