paragraph
 Atari ST BASIC (or ST Basic) was the first dialect of BASIC that was produced for the Atari ST line of computers. It was bundled with all new STs in the early years of the ST's lifespan, and quickly became the standard BASIC for that platform. However, many users disliked it, and improved dialects of BASIC quickly came out to replace it.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST_BASIC">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
