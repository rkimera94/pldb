* Basic4GL (B4GL; from Basic for openGL) is an interpreted, open source version of the BASIC programming language which features support for 3D computer graphics using OpenGL. While being interpreted, it is also able to compile programs on top of the virtual machine to produce standalone executable programs. It uses a syntax similar to traditional dialects of BASIC and features an IDE and a very thorough and comprehensive debugger. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic4GL">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
