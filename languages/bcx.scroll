paragraph
 BCX is a free software programming development application originally created in 1999 by Kevin Diggins.  BCX converts BASIC source code to C/C++ source code which can then be compiled using any one of a number of available Microsoft Win32 C/C++ compilers. For many years, most implementations of BASIC shared a nagging drawback - the programs that users created performed slower than similar programs that were created using C/C++. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCX">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
