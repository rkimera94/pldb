paragraph
 Beta BASIC is a BASIC interpreter for the Sinclair Research ZX Spectrum microcomputer, written by Dr Andy Wright in 1983 and sold by his one-man software house BetaSoft. BetaSoft also produced a regular newsletter/magazine, BetaNews. Originally it started as a BASIC toolkit but over time it grew into a full replacement.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_BASIC">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
