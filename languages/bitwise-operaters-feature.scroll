paragraph
 Bitwise Operators are a <a href="../lists/features.html">language feature</a>.









paragraph
 In digital computer programming, a bitwise operation operates on one or more bit patterns or binary numerals at the level of their individual bits. It is a fast and simple action, directly supported by the processor, and is used to manipulate values for comparisons and calculations. On simple low-cost processors, typically, bitwise operations are substantially faster than division, several times faster than multiplication, and sometimes significantly faster than addition. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>

code
 int i = 4; /* bit pattern equivalent is binary 100 */
 int j = i &lt;&lt; 2; /* makes it binary 10000, which multiplies the original number by 4 i.e. 16 */
