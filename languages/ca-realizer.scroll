paragraph
 CA-Realizer was a BASIC-language software development product originally developed by Within Technologies, but first commercially released by Computer Associates, as CA-Realizer 1.0 in 1992. Several versions were released, that provided a version of the BASIC programming language, a Rapid application development tool, including forms building and some powerful built-in components, that was comparable to, and competitive with Microsoft Visual Basic, in its early days.  It offered some functionality (like a fairly useful spreadsheet) and cross-platform capability. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CA-Realizer">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
