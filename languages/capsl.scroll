paragraph
 a high-level language to support security analysis of cryptographic authentication and key distribution protocols. It is translated to CIL, an intermediate language expressing state transitions with term-rewriting rules. Connectors are being written to adapt CIL to supply input to different security analysis tools, including PVS for inductive verification and Maude for model-checking.
