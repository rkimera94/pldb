paragraph
 Cecil is a pure object-oriented programming language that was developed by Craig Chambers at the University of Washington in 1992 to be part of the Vortex project there. Cecil has many similarities to other object-oriented languages, most notably Objective-C, Modula-3, and Self. The main goals of the project were extensibility, orthogonality, efficiency, and ease-of-use. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecil_(programming_language)">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
