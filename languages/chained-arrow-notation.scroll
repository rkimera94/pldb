paragraph
 Conway chained arrow notation, created by mathematician John Horton Conway, is a means of expressing certain extremely large numbers. It is simply a finite sequence of positive integers separated by rightward arrows, e.g.                         2         →         3         →         4         →         5         →         6                 {\displaystyle 2\to 3\to 4\to 5\to 6}   . <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway_chained_arrow_notation">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
