paragraph
 Concurrent MetateM is a multi-agent language in which each agent is programmed using a set of (augmented) temporal logic specifications of the behaviour it should exhibit. These specifications are executed directly to generate the behaviour of the agent. As a result, there is no risk of invalidating the logic as with systems where logical specification must first be translated to a lower-level implementation. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_MetateM">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
