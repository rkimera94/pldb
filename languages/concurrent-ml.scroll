paragraph
 Concurrent ML (CML) is a concurrent extension of the Standard ML programming language characterized by its ability to allow programmers to create composable communication abstractions that are first class rather than built into the language. The design of CML and its primitive operations have been adopted in several other programming languages such as GNU Guile, Racket, and Manticore.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_ML">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
