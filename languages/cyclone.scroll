paragraph
 The Cyclone programming language is intended to be a safe dialect of the C language. Cyclone is designed to avoid buffer overflows and other vulnerabilities that are possible in C programs, without losing the power and convenience of C as a tool for system programming. Cyclone development was started as a joint project of AT&T Labs Research and Greg Morrisett's group at Cornell in 2001. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_(programming_language)">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
