paragraph
 Dartmouth BASIC is the original version of the BASIC programming language.  It is so named because it was designed and implemented at Dartmouth College by John Kem√©ny and Thomas Kurtz. It was developed as part of the Dartmouth Time Sharing System (DTSS) and was one of the first programming languages intended to be used interactively. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmouth_BASIC">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
