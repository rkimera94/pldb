paragraph
 DIANA, the Descriptive Intermediate Attributed Notation for Ada, is an intermediate language used to represent the semantics of an Ada program. It was originally designed as an interface between the front end (syntactic analysis) and middle (semantic analysis) of the compiler on the one hand and the back end (code generation and optimization) on the other. It is also used as an internal representation by other language tools. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIANA_(intermediate_language)">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
