paragraph
 <a href='https://github.com/Dyvil/Dyvil'>Dyvil</a> is a multi-paradigm, general purpose programming language that is based on Java and the JVM. It is a compiled, statically and strongly typed language that supports object-oriented, functional and imperative programming styles. The language features many high-level constructs as well as an extensible and expressive syntax, making it highly useful for both rapid and safe prototyping, and the creation of domain-specific languages.
