paragraph
 Edh is a dynamically & strongly typed, procedural (thus imperative), value-oriented (i.e. immutable first, yet with non-traditional Object constructs), interpreted programming language, that parasitic on GHC and heavily relying on the Haskell implementation of Software Transactional Memory for unified intuition of concurrency and data-consistency.
