paragraph
 Edinburgh IMP is a development of ATLAS Autocode, initially developed around 1966-1969 at Edinburgh University, Scotland.  IMP was a general-purpose programming language which was used heavily for systems programming. Expressively, IMP is extremely similar to Algol and includes all the Algol-style block structure, reserved keywords, and datatypes such as arrays and records. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_IMP">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
