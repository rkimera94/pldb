paragraph
 This article is about the programming language. For the university, see Escuela Superior Politecnica del Litoral.ESPOL (short for Executive Systems Problem Oriented Language) was a superset of ALGOL 60 that provided capabilities of what would later be known as Mohols, machine oriented high order languages, such as interrupting a processor on a multiprocessor system (the Burroughs large systems were multiprocessor processor systems). ESPOL was used to write the MCP (Master Control Program) on Burroughs computer systems from the B5000 to the B6700. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Systems_Problem_Oriented_Language">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
