* EUMEL (pronounced oimel for Extendable Multi User Microprocessor ELAN System and also known as L2 for Liedtke 2) is an operating system which began as a run-time environment for the ELAN programming language. It was created in 1979 by Jochen Liedtke at the University of Bielefeld. EUMEL initially ran on the 8-bit Z80 processor, and was later ported to many different architectures. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eumel">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
