* FOCAL is an interpreted programming language resembling JOSS. The name is an acronym for Formulating On-Line Calculations in Algebraic Language. Largely the creation of Richard Merrill, FOCAL was initially written for and had its largest impact on the Digital Equipment Corporation's (DEC's) PDP-8 computers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOCAL_(programming_language)">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
