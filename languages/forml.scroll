exampleCodeHeader Example from the web:
code
     hello_world = do
         `console.log(&quot;Hello World&quot;)` -- Calls to Javascript always return type `JS a`
         x &lt;- `Math.sqrt(9)`          -- `x` is inferred to be the unrestricted type `a`
         let z = x + 1                -- `x` is now restricted to type `Num`
         return (z + 1)                  -- type of `hello_world` is inferred to be `JS Num`
     8 == do! hello_world &gt;&gt;= Î»x = `x + 3`
