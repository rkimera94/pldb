paragraph
 Fuzuli has a syntax similar to Lisp but it is not intended to be an other Lisp clone. It has got several properties inhereted from Algol family and others. For example; syntax of while and foreach statements were directly derived from C++ and R, respectively. Some string manipulation functions share the same names and definitions from Visual Basic. Math and IO libraries are like C++ standard library and MySql library uses libmysql directly.

         (for (let i 0) (&lt; i (length x)) (inc i)
             (let dist (+ dist (pow (- (nth x i) (nth y i)) 2)))
         )
     (return dist)
