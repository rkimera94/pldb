paragraph
 FX-87 is a polymorphic typed functional language based on a system for static program analysis in which every expression has two static properties: a type and an effect. In a study done by MIT, FX-87 yields similar performance results as functional languages on programs that do not contain side effects (Fibonacci, Factorial). FX-87 did yield a great performance increase when matching DNA sequences.KFX is the kernel language of FX-87. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FX-87">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
