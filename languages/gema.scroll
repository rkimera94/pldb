paragraph
 A general-purpose macro processor or general purpose preprocessor is a macro processor that is not tied to or integrated with a particular language or piece of software. A macro processor is a program that copies a stream of text from one place to another, making a systematic set of replacements as it does so. Macro processors are often embedded in other programs, such as assemblers and compilers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_macro_processor">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
