paragraph
 The General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) is a high-level modeling system for mathematical optimization. GAMS is designed for modeling and solving linear, nonlinear, and mixed-integer optimization problems. The system is tailored for complex, large-scale modeling applications and allows the user to build large maintainable models that can be adapted to new situations. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Algebraic_Modeling_System">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
