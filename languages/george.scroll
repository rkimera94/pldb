paragraph
 GEORGE is a programming language invented by Charles Leonard Hamblin in 1957.It was designed around a push-down pop-up stack for arithmetic operations, and employed reverse Polish notation. The language included loops, subroutines, conditionals, vectors, and matrices. Algebraic expressions were written in reverse Polish notation; thus,                         a         +         b                 {\displaystyle a+b}    was written a b +, and similarly for the other arithmetic operations of subtraction, multiplication, and division. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GEORGE_(programming_language)">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
