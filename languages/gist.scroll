paragraph
 In computing, GiST or Generalized Search Tree, is a data structure and API that can be used to build a variety of disk-based search trees.  GiST is a generalization of the B+ tree, providing a concurrent and recoverable height-balanced search tree infrastructure without making any assumptions about the type of data being stored, or the queries being serviced.  GiST can be used to easily implement a range of well-known indexes, including B+ trees, R-trees, hB-trees, RD-trees, and many others; it also allows for easy development of specialized indexes for new data types. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GiST">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
