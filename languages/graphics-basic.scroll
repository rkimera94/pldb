paragraph
 Graphics BASIC is a third-party extension to the Commodore BASIC V2.0 programming language of the Commodore 64 computer. It was originally written in 1983 by Ron Gilbert and Tom McFarlane. The program was licensed to Hesware, who briefly sold the program in 1984 as part of their product line before going out of business. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_BASIC">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
