paragraph
 HAL/S (High-order Assembly Language/Shuttle)  is a real-time aerospace programming language compiler and cross-compiler for avionics applications used by NASA and associated agencies (JPL, etc.). It has been used in many U.S. space projects since 1973 and its most significant use was in the Space Shuttle program (approximately 85% of the Shuttle software is coded in HAL/S). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL/S">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
