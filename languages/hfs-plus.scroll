paragraph
 HFS Plus or HFS+ is a file system developed by Apple Inc.  It replaced the Hierarchical File System (HFS) as the primary file system of Apple computers with the 1998 release of Mac OS 8.1.  HFS+ continued as the primary Mac OS X file system until it was itself replaced with the release of the Apple File System (APFS) with macOS High Sierra in 2017. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFS_Plus">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
