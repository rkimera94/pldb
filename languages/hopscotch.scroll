paragraph
 Hopscotch is a visual programming language developed by Hopscotch Technologies, designed to allow young or beginner programmers to develop simple projects. Its simple UI allows its users to drag and drop blocks to create scripts of which can be played when activated. Although the language is easy to use, to develop more advanced pieces of code is almost impossible and requires more powerful languages. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopscotch_(programming_language)">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
