paragraph
 HP Time-Shared BASIC (HP TSB) is an interpreter software system that was sold by the Hewlett-Packard Company in the late 1960s and 1970s, based on their HP 2100 line of minicomputers. The system implements a dialect of the BASIC programming language and a rudimentary user account and program library system. The system is historically notable as the platform that released the first public versions of the game Star Trek. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP_Time-Shared_BASIC">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
