HyTime defines a set of hypertext-oriented element types that, in effect, supplement SGML and allow SGML document authors to build hypertext and multimedia presentations in a standardized way. HyTime is an international standard published by the ISO and IEC. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyTime">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
