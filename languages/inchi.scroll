* The IUPAC International Chemical Identifier (InChI  IN-chee or  ING-kee) is a textual identifier for chemical substances, designed to provide a standard way to encode molecular information and to facilitate the search for such information in databases and on the web. Initially developed by IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) and NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) from 2000 to 2005, the format and algorithms are non-proprietary. The continuing development of the standard has been supported since 2010 by the not-for-profit InChI Trust, of which IUPAC is a member. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Chemical_Identifier">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
