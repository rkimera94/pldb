exampleCodeHeader Example from the web:
code
 - I looked at Monsieur Fogg 
 *   ... and I could contain myself no longer.
     &#39;What is the purpose of our journey, Monsieur?&#39;
     &#39;A wager,&#39; he replied.
     * *     &#39;A wager!&#39;[] I returned.
             He nodded. 
             * * *   &#39;But surely that is foolishness!&#39;
             * * *  &#39;A most serious matter then!&#39;
             - - -   He nodded again.
             * * *   &#39;But can we win?&#39;
                     &#39;That is what we will endeavour to find out,&#39; he answered.
             * * *   &#39;A modest wager, I trust?&#39;
                     &#39;Twenty thousand pounds,&#39; he replied, quite flatly.
             * * *   I asked nothing further of him then[.], and after a final, polite cough, he  offered nothing more to me. &lt;&gt;
     * *     &#39;Ah[.&#39;],&#39; I replied, uncertain what I thought.
     - -     After that, &lt;&gt;
 *   ... but I said nothing[] and &lt;&gt; 
 - we passed the day in silence.
 - -&gt; END
