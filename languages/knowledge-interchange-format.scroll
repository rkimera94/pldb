paragraph
 Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) is a computer language designed to enable systems to share and re-use information from knowledge-based systems. KIF is similar to frame languages such as KL-One and LOOM but unlike such language its primary role is not intended as a framework for the expression or use of knowledge but rather for the interchange of knowledge between systems. The designers of KIF likened it to PostScript. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Interchange_Format">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
