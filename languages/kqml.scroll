* The Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language, or KQML, is a language and protocol for communication among software agents and knowledge-based systems. It was developed in the early 1990s part of the DARPA knowledge Sharing Effort, which was aimed at developing techniques for building large-scale knowledge bases which are shareable and reusable. While originally conceived of as an interface to knowledge based systems, it was soon repurposed as an Agent communication language.Work on KQML was led by Tim Finin of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and  Jay Weber of EITech and involved contributions from many researchers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_Query_and_Manipulation_Language">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
