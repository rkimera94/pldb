* λProlog, also written lambda Prolog, is a logic programming language featuring polymorphic typing, modular programming, and higher-order programming.  These extensions to Prolog are derived from the higher-order hereditary Harrop formulas used to justify the foundations of λProlog.  Higher-order quantification, simply typed λ-terms, and higher-order unification gives λProlog the basic supports needed to capture the λ-tree syntax approach to higher-order abstract syntax, an approach to representing syntax that maps object-level bindings to programming language bindings. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9BProlog">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
