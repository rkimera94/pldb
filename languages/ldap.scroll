* The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol  (LDAP ) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.  Directory services play an important role in developing intranet and Internet applications by allowing the sharing of information about users, systems, networks, services, and applications throughout the network.  As examples, directory services may provide any organized set of records, often with a hierarchical structure, such as a corporate email directory. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
