paragraph
 Second Life is an online virtual world, developed and owned by the San Francisco-based  firm Linden Lab and launched on June 23, 2003. By 2013, Second Life had approximately one million regular users. In many ways, Second Life is similar to massively multiplayer online role-playing games; however, Linden Lab is emphatic that their creation is not a game: "There is no manufactured conflict, no set objective".The virtual world can be accessed freely via Linden Lab's own client programs or via alternative third-party viewers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linden_Scripting_Language">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
