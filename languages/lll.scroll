paragraph
 LLL is one of the original Ethereum smart contract programming languages and provides a different perspective and programming discipline when compared to the ubiquitous Solidity language. Lisp Like Language (LLL) is a low level language similar to Assembly. It is meant to be very simple and minimalistic; essentially just a tiny wrapper over coding in EVM directly.
