paragraph
 Loglan is a constructed language originally designed for linguistic research, particularly for investigating the Sapirâ€“Whorf Hypothesis. The language was developed beginning in 1955 by Dr James Cooke Brown with the goal of making a language so different from natural languages that people learning it would think in a different way if the hypothesis were true. In 1960 Scientific American published an article introducing the language. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loglan">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
