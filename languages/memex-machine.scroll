paragraph
 The memex (originally coined "at random", though sometimes said to be a portmanteau of "memory" and "index") is the name of the hypothetical proto-hypertext system that Vannevar Bush described in his 1945 The Atlantic Monthly article "As We May Think". Bush envisioned the memex as a device in which individuals would compress and store all of their books, records, and communications, "mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility".  The memex would provide an "enlarged intimate supplement to one's memory". <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
