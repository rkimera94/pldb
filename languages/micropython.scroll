paragraph
 MicroPython is a software implementation of the Python 3 programming language, written in C, that is optimized to run on a microcontroller. MicroPython is a full Python compiler and runtime that runs on the micro-controller hardware. The user is presented with an interactive prompt (the REPL) to execute supported commands immediately. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroPython">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
