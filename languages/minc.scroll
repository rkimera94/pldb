paragraph
 MINC ("MINC is not C") is a data specification language written in the mid-1980s by a Princeton University graduate student named Lars Graf. This kind of naming is known as a "recursive acronym".  It contains many (though not all) of the syntactical capabilities of the C programming language, and can be used to implement simple procedural programs that can be executed by a runtime parser (that is to say, MINC does not need to be compiled in any way). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MINC">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
