paragraph
 MUSIC/SP (Multi-User System for Interactive Computing/System Product; originally "McGill University System for Interactive Computing") was developed at McGill University in the 1970s from an early IBM time-sharing system called RAX (Remote Access Computing System). The system ran on IBM  S/360,  S/370, and  4300-series  mainframe hardware, and offered novel features (for the time) such as file access control and data compression. It was designed to allow academics and students to create and run their programs interactively on  terminals, in an era when most mainframe computing was still being done from punched cards. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSIC/SP">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
