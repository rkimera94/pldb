paragraph
 Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed. It differs from other build systems in two major respects: it is designed to have its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and it is designed to run builds as fast as possible. In essence, Ninja is meant to replace Make, which is slow when performing incremental (or no-op) builds. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_(build_system)">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
