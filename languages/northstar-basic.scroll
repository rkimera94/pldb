* NorthStar BASIC was a dialect of the programming language BASIC originally provided for use on the NorthStar Horizon and NorthStar Advantage. The interpreter was written using only Intel 8080 instructions so that it could run also on custom systems.  One notable difference with other dialects of BASIC of the time was the array-like way in which strings were addressed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NorthStar_BASIC">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
