paragraph
 Object-Z is an object-oriented extension to the Z notation developed at the University of Queensland, Australia. Object-Z extends Z by the addition of language constructs resembling the object-oriented paradigm, most notably, classes. Other object-oriented notions such as polymorphism and inheritance are also supported. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Z">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
