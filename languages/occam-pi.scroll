 In computer science, occam-π (or occam-pi) is the name of a variant of the programming language occam developed by the Kent Retargetable occam Compiler (KRoC) team at the University of Kent. The name reflects the introduction of elements of π-calculus (pi-calculus) into occam, especially concepts involving mobile agents (processes) and data. The language contains several extensions to occam 2.1, including:  Nested protocols Run-time process creation Mobile channels, data, and processes Recursion Protocol inheritance Array constructors Extended rendezvous. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam-π">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
