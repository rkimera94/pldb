paragraph
 Object-Graph Navigation Language (OGNL) is an open-source Expression Language (EL) for Java, which, while using simpler expressions than the full range of those supported by the Java language, allows getting and setting properties (through defined setProperty and getProperty methods, found in JavaBeans), and execution of methods of Java classes. It also allows for simpler array manipulation. It is aimed to be used in Java EE applications with taglibs as expression language. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OGNL">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
