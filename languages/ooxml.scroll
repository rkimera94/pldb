* Office Open XML (also informally known as OOXML or Microsoft Open XML (MOX)) is a zipped, XML-based file format developed by Microsoft for representing spreadsheets, charts, presentations and word processing documents. The format was initially standardized by Ecma (as ECMA-376), and by the ISO and IEC (as ISO/IEC 29500) in later versions. Starting with Microsoft Office 2007, the Office Open XML file formats have become the default target file format of Microsoft Office. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Open_XML">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
