paragraph
 OpenEXR is a high dynamic range raster file format, released as an open standard along with a set of software tools created by Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), under a free software license similar to the BSD license.It is notable for supporting multiple channels of potentially different pixel sizes, including 64-, 32- and 16-bit floating point values, as well as various compression techniques which include lossless and lossy compression algorithms.  It also has arbitrary channels and encodes multiple points of view such as left- and right-camera images.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenEXR">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
