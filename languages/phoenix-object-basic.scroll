paragraph
 Phoenix Object Basic is an object-oriented rapid application development tool for Linux. It has object-oriented features such as inheritance and polymorphism as found in languages such as Python and Perl. It also features a similar design environment and compatible syntax to Visual Basic reducing the learning curve for those making a transition from that language to Linux programming. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Object_Basic">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
