paragraph
 Pict is a statically typed programming language, one of the very few based on the Ï€-calculus. Work on the language began at the University of Edinburgh in 1992, and development has been more or less dormant since 1998. The language is still at an experimental stage.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pict_(programming_language)">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
