paragraph
 <a href='https://pisc.junglecoder.com/'>PISC</a> attempts to make concatenative programming less mind-bendy via pervasive use of locals, closures, the smallest set of syntax hacks to make code look nice. PISC is a stack-based programming language that is primarily inspired by factor, TCL, bash and a little bit of python, written in go.
