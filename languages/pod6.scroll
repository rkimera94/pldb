exampleCodeHeader Example from the web:
code
 =begin pod
  This is an ordinary paragraph
 
     While this is not
     This is a code block
     
     =head1 Mumble mumble
     
     Suprisingly, this is not a code block
         (with fancy indentation too)
 
 But this is just a text. Again
 
 =end pod
