paragraph
 Pro*C (also known as Pro*C/C++) is an embedded SQL programming language used by Oracle Database database management systems.  Pro*C uses either C or C++ as its host language.  During compilation, the embedded SQL statements are interpreted by a precompiler and replaced by C or C++ function calls to their respective SQL library. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro*C">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
