paragraph
 RAMIS (Random Access Management Information System) is a fourth-generation programming language (4GL) capable of creating and maintaining databases consisting of named files containing both numeric and alphabetic fields and subsequently producing detailed simple or complex reports using a very simple English like language.  As such it is easily mastered by non-programmers. A typical program - either to create or maintain a database or to create quite complex reports - would normally consist of a handful of lines of code which could be written or understood by non-professional programmers. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramis_software">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
