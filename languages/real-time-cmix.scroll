* Real-Time Cmix (RTcmix) is one of the MUSIC-N family of computer music programming languages.  RTcmix is descended from the MIX program developed by Paul Lansky at Princeton University in 1978 to perform algorithmic composition using digital audio soundfiles on a IBM 3031 mainframe computer.  After synthesis functions were added, the program was renamed Cmix in the 1980s. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_Cmix">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
