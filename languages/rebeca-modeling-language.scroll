paragraph
 Rebeca (acronym for Reactive Objects Language) is an actor-based modeling language with a formal foundation, designed in an effort to bridge the gap between formal verification approaches and real applications. It can be considered as a reference model for concurrent computation, based on an operational interpretation of the actor model. It is also a platform for developing object-based concurrent systems in practice. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebeca_Modeling_Language">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
