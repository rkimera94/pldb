exampleCodeHeader Example from the web:
code
 // Stage
 //   - A target object of this simulation
 stage n as long; // the number of mice
 // Parameter
 param c as int;  // the number of mice which one mouse gives birth to
 // Initialization
 init {
     n&lt;0&gt; = 2; // n&lt;0&gt; means the value of n when time is 0
 }
 // Operation
 //   - Code which is executed every time (like recurrence formula)
 operation {
     n&lt;next&gt; = n&lt;now&gt; * c; // &quot;now&quot; and &quot;next&quot; are keywords in Ripple. next == now + 1.
