* Rlab is an interactive, interpreted numerical computation program and its core programming language, written by Ian Searle. Rlab (the language) is very high level and is intended to provide fast prototyping and program development, as well as easy data-visualization, and processing. Rlab was not designed as a clone of MATLAB. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rlab">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
