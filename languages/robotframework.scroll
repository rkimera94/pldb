 Documentation     Example test case using the gherkin syntax.
 ...
 ...               This test has a workflow similar to the keyword-driven
 ...               examples. The difference is that the keywords use higher
 ...               abstraction level and their arguments are embedded into
 ...               the keyword names.
 ...
 ...               This kind of _gherkin_ syntax has been made popular by
 ...               [http://cukes.info|Cucumber]. It works well especially when
 ...               tests act as examples that need to be easily understood also
 ...               by the business people.
