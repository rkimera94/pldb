paragraph
 R++ is a rule-based programming language based on C++. The United States patent describes R++ as follows:  The R++ extension permits rules to be defined as members of C++ classes. The programming system of the invention takes the classes with rules defined using R++ and generates C++ code from them in which the machinery required for the rules is implemented completely as C++ data members and functions of the classes involved in the rules. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R%2B%2B">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
