* SASL (from St Andrews Static Language, alternatively  St Andrews Standard Language) is a purely functional programming language developed by David Turner at the University of St Andrews in 1972, based on the applicative subset of ISWIM.  In 1976 Turner redesigned and reimplemented it as a non-strict (lazy) language.  In this form it was the foundation of Turner's later languages KRC and Miranda, but SASL appears to be untyped whereas Miranda has polymorphic types. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SASL_%28programming_language%29">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
