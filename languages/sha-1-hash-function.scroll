paragraph
 In cryptography, SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a cryptographic hash function which takes an input and  produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value known as a message digest â€“ typically rendered as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long. It was designed by the United States National Security Agency, and is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard.Since 2005 SHA-1 has not been considered secure against well-funded opponents, as of 2010 many organizations have recommended its replacement. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
