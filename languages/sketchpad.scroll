 Sketchpad (a.k.a. Robot Draftsman) was a computer program written by Ivan Sutherland in 1963 in the course of his PhD thesis, for which he received the Turing Award in 1988, and the Kyoto Prize in 2012.  It pioneered the way for humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
