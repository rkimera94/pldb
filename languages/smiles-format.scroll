paragraph
 The simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) is a specification in the form of a line notation for describing the structure of chemical species using short ASCII strings. SMILES strings can be imported by most molecule editors for conversion back into two-dimensional drawings or three-dimensional models of the molecules. The original SMILES specification was initiated in the 1980s. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_molecular-input_line-entry_system">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
