 Schema for Object-Oriented XML, or SOX, is an XML schema language developed by Commerce One. In 1998 a SOX specification was submitted to the World Wide Web Consortium and published as a W3C Note. A revised version, SOX 2.0, was published as a W3C Note in 1999. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_for_Object-Oriented_XML">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
