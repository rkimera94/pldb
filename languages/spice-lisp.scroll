paragraph
 Spice Lisp is a Lisp dialect and its implementation originally written by CMU's Spice Lisp Group which targeted the microcode of the 16-bit PERQ workstation and its Accent operating system; it used that workstation's microcode abilities (it provided microcodes for Pascal, C, and Ada besides) to implement a stack architecture to store its data structures as 32-bit objects and to enable runtime type-checking. It would later be popular on other workstations. Spice Lisp evolved into CMUCL, a Common Lisp implementation.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice_Lisp">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
