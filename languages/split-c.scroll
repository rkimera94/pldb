* Split-C is a parallel extension of the C programming language. The Split-C project website describes Split-C as:  a parallel extension of the C programming language that supports efficient access to a global address space on current distributed memory multiprocessors. It retains the "small language" character of C and supports careful engineering and optimization of programs by providing a simple, predictable cost model. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-C">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
