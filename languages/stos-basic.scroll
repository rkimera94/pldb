* STOS BASIC is a dialect of the BASIC programming language implemented on the Atari ST computer. STOS BASIC was originally developed by Jawx, Fran√ßois Lionet, and Constantin Sotiropoulos and published by Mandarin Software (now known as Europress Software). STOS Basic was a version of BASIC that was designed for creating games, but the set of powerful high-level graphics and sound commands it offered made it suitable for developing multimedia-intense software without any knowledge of the internals of the Atari ST.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOS_BASIC">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
