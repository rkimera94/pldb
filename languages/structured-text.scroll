paragraph
 Structured text, abbreviated as ST or STX, is one of the five languages supported by the IEC 61131-3 standard, designed for programmable logic controllers (PLCs). It is a high level language that is block structured and syntactically resembles Pascal, on which it is based. All of the languages share IEC61131 Common Elements. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_text">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
