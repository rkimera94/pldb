* STx implements a powerful scripting language. This document will try to give you the necessary information to program your own applications. Scripts can be used to implement: simple processing lists, calling standard STx signal processing applications, signal processing application (like the Spectrogram & Parameters Viewer), complex database operations on the STx DataSet, in fact, everything you see in STx can be programmed in the macro language. The term STx script is a synonym for an application implemented using one or more STx macros, classes and SPU's, and executed by the script controller application BScript.
