paragraph
 The tap code, sometimes called the knock code, is a way to encode text messages on a letter-by-letter basis in a very simple way. The message is transmitted using a series of tap sounds, hence its name. The tap code has been commonly used by prisoners to communicate with each other. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tap_code">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
