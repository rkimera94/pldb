* A telos (from the Greek τέλος for "end", "purpose", or "goal") is an end or purpose, in a fairly constrained sense used by philosophers such as Aristotle.  It is the root of the term "teleology", roughly the study of purposiveness, or the study of objects with a view to their aims, purposes, or intentions.  Teleology figures centrally in Aristotle's biology and in his theory of causes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telos">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
