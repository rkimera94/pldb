 In 1979, Honeywell Information Systems announced a new programming language for their time-sharing service named TEX, an acronym for the Text Executive text processing system. TEX was a first generation scripting language, developed around the time of AWK and used by Honeywell initially as an in-house system test automation tool. TEX extended the Honeywell Time-Sharing service (TSS) line editor with programmable capabilities which allowed the user greater latitude in developing ease-of-use editing extensions as well as write scripts to automate many other time-sharing tasks formerly done by more complex TSS FORTRAN programs.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Executive_Programming_Language">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
