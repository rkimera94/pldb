paragraph
 TOM was an object-oriented programming language developed in the 1990s that built on the lessons learned from Objective-C. The main purpose of TOM was to allow for "unplanned reuse" of code via a well-developed extension mechanism. This concept was introduced seemingly by accident in Objective-C and later proved to be of wide use, and was applied aggressively in TOM. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TOM_(object-oriented_programming_language)">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
