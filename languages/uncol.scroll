* UNCOL (Universal Computer Oriented Language) was a proposed universal intermediate language for compilers introduced by Melvin E. Conway in 1958. It was never fully specified or implemented; in many ways it was more a concept than a language. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNCOL">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
