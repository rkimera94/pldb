paragraph
 Visual Smalltalk Enterprise (VSE) is a Smalltalk dialect that runs only on Microsoft Windows, and is the last in a long line of Smalltalk implementations first produced by Digitalk and now available through Cincom. Active development has stopped since late 1997 and VSE is now only available as a version called VSE 2000, and only to licensed users of previous VSE versions.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Smalltalk_Enterprise">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
