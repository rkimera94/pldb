paragraph
 VTL-2 is the second Very Tiny Language developed for the Altair 680 Computer system. VTL-2 represents an enormous improvement over the earlier VTL-1 language, and incorporates some thirty additional features. In spite of these enhancements, it still requires only 768 bytes of Read-Only-Memory, and still fits into the three empty PROM sockets already on the 680 CPU board.
