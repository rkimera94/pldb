paragraph
 The Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS) defines a language for filtering and processing of multi-dimensional raster coverages, such as sensor, simulation, image, and statistics data. The Web Coverage Processing Service is maintained by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). This raster query language allows clients to obtain original coverage data, or derived information, in a platform-neutral manner over the Web.. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Coverage_Processing_Service">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
