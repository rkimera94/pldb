paragraph
 Website Meta Language (WML) and its associated command wmk are together a free and extensible web designer's off-line HTML generation toolkit for Unix, distributed under the GNU General Public License (GPL v2). It works as an off-line content management system. It is written in ANSI C and Perl 5, built via a GNU Autoconf based source tree and runs out-of-the-box on all major Unix derivates. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_Meta_Language">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
