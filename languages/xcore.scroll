paragraph
 The XCore Architecture is a 32-bit RISC microprocessor architecture designed by XMOS. The architecture is designed to be used in multi-core processors for embedded systems. Each XCore executes up to eight concurrent threads, each thread having its own register set, and the architecture directly supports inter-thread and inter-core communication and various forms of thread scheduling. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCore_Architecture">Read more on Wikipedia...</a>
